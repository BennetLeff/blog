            I've crossed the one year mark writing software as a contractor.
            Before that I worked for a design firm, a bank, and a startup. I
            learned more in one year than in the past years combined. I did this
            all in Mexico so I now fluently speak Spanish and got the chance to
            cook professionally in my free-time. If you're looking for someone
            to implement state-of-the-art ML papers or teach you regional
            Mexican cuisine, I'm your guy. I've spent a few years developing
            full-stack in React + Node incase that's what you need.

            Anyways, professionally I'm currently working on a Rust based
            rendering engine to bring a few Computer Vision papers to market as
            an actual product. Before I uprooted myself to another country, I
            was pursuing a masters degree in AI and I've kept up with the
            literature since then. After I saw the incredible "3D Gaussian
            Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering" and "Zip-NeRF"
            papers, I felt the literature was mature enough to utilize in a 3D
            visualization project I've been a part of.

            What do these papers have to do with anything? They're based on
            differentiable rendering. Basically, the rendering process is a
            function that takes some objects (commonly placed by an artist) and
            paints pixels on the screen. If we slightly update the rendering
            process, we can perform <b>calculus</b> on the rendering function.
            That's handy because Machine Learning finds good solutions to most
            problems using calculus. Look at

            for a visual explanation.

          <p class="text-xl my-2">
            To motivate the extra machine learning baggage, consider the problem
            of inverse graphics. Suppose we have photos of an object or a scene
            or whatever, and we want to reconstruct the subject in the computer.
            We can train a model - sometimes a neural network - to "fit" the
            scene.
          </p>
          <p class="text-xl my-2">
            Imagine some knobs that control how much red, green, and blue flow
            into a pixel. In the first network pictured below all knobs are set
            to 0, so the output pixel is black. In the next network, we've
            fiddled with the knobs such that the amount of red, green, and blue
            flowing out set the pixel to a purple hue. If we assign knobs to
            every pixel on your screen, you can control the image your computer
            creates. Along with a large bag of tricks, we can fiddle knobs until
            a large set of pixels looks like an image we want to create.
