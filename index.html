            I've crossed the one year mark writing software as a contractor.
            Before that I worked for a design firm, a bank, and a startup. I
            learned more in one year than in the past years combined. I did this
            all in Mexico so I now fluently speak Spanish and got the chance to
            cook professionally in my free-time. If you're looking for someone
            to implement state-of-the-art ML papers or teach you regional
            Mexican cuisine, I'm your guy. I've spent a few years developing
            full-stack in React + Node incase that's what you need.

            Anyways, professionally I'm currently working on a Rust based
            rendering engine to bring a few Computer Vision papers to market as
            an actual product. Before I uprooted myself to another country, I
            was pursuing a masters degree in AI and I've kept up with the
            literature since then. After I saw the incredible "3D Gaussian
            Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering" and "Zip-NeRF"
            papers, I felt the literature was mature enough to utilize in a 3D
            visualization project I've been a part of.

            So what are these overly academic sounding things? They're based on
            differentiable rendering. The idea is: The rendering process is a
            function that takes some objects (usually placed by an artist) and
            paints pixels on the screen. If we slightly update the rendering
            process, we can perform <b>calculus</b> on the rendering function.
            That's handy because machine learning finds good solutions to most
            problems using calculus. Look at
